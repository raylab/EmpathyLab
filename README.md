# django_empathy_laboratory
Empathy Lab "Lab Log" website written in Django.

----

This web application creates an online lablog, where users can browse available experiments, manage their accounts and create new records.

The main features that have currently been implemented are:

* There are models for experiments, records, stimulae, feedback and sybjects.
* Users can view list and detail information for experiments and subjects.
* Admin users can create and manage models. The admin has been optimised (the basic registration is present in admin.py, but commented out).
* Librarians can renew reserved records

Based on ![Local Library Model](https://github.com/mdn/django-locallibrary-tutorial/blob/master/lablog/static/images/local_library_model_uml.png)
